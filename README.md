# TakeMeToNito
A simple tweak /module that provides a shortcut in the control center of Apple TV to the Nito TV package manager.
Tweak is fully functional for Apple TV's on tvOS 13-14.3 (or later until tvOS 15 most likely)
(Still need to add a proper glyph NitoTV icon.)
Just need permission to use before taking one. This tweak currently has a rectangular shaped glyph, with no writing.
Once the proper icon is added it will be easier to tell which toggle is the NitoTV shortcut.
