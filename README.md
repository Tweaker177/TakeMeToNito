# TakeMeToNito
A simple tweak /module that provides a shortcut in the control center of Apple TV to the Nito TV package manager.
Tweak is fully functional for Apple TV's on tvOS 13-14.3 (or later until tvOS 15 most likely)

Thanks to Lechium for making ControlCenterTV (a lot of this code is built off it's foundation) and iKilledAppl3 for putting up with my noob questions, lol.
