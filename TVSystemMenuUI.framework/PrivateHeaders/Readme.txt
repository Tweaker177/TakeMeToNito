These headers are all from NitoTV / lecheum's github, (also in the fork I made of TVControlCenter, but it has zero commits from me). The license for his code applies to this project as well, since it's very similar and has a lot of overlapping code.
I think his license was MIT?  
I'll find out the proper way to give credit to the ones that made this so easy to do soon. (iKilledAppl3 also put up with several total noob questions and was helpful as well)
